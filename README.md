# THICC
Thorough Harmonic Interface Creation Coordinator

### What is THICC?
THICC is a GUI library for Love2D created to enable the creation of beautiful GUIs easily. THICC has many features that replace using various functions, math, recurring code and drawables.

### See THICC in action
You can download a `.love` file [here](https://github.com/EWalnut/THICC) (Not tested on Love2D versions older than 11.2). This file contains examples of the type of user interfaces that are possible with THICC. 

### Getting Started
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/EWalnut/THICC)

### Tweening
THICC has an optional tweening feature. This requires an equasion library available [here](https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/easing/blob/master/lib/easing.lua). If the library is not present tweening will be disabled.
